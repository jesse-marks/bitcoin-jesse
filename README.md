**Ideas**
- [ ] Create an issue for each of the following and then resolve them with a commit.
- [ ] Make the logged in from a different base template. Use blueprints.
- [ ] Only show flash once. Make not persistent.
- [ ] Create secure login. 
- [ ] Have a function that will create a private key (make sure to warn user not to use this) then show the different formats the key can be in. For each key format provide the definition.
- [ ] Describe how public/private key pairs are created. Talk about the Elliptic curve secp256k1 is used and the parameters. Break out my old abstract algebra book to talk about the definition of a finite field.
- [ ] Talk about running a local version of bitcoin wit regtest ([regression test mode](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/109653/why-is-regtest-called-regtest)). Have links to Saylor.edu and https://bitcoindev.network/bitcoin-cli-sandbox/  show how addresses are made and how hdkeypath changes for each address.
