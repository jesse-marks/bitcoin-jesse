**Ideas**
- [X] Add current price

- [ ] Talk about running a local version of bitcoin wit regtest ([regression test mode](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/109653/why-is-regtest-called-regtest)). Have links to Saylor.edu and https://bitcoindev.network/bitcoin-cli-sandbox/  show how addresses are made and how hdkeypath changes for each address.
